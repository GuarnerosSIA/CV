  <h1>Reinforcement learning for controlling continuous systems with
    uncertain dynamics and restricted states using robust neural dynamic
    programming</h1>
    <p>
      The present page describes the proposition of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find the optimal 
      tracking control of a continuous system with uncertain dynamics and subjected to physical constraints. 
      The so-called Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) that present nonlinearities, hysteresis and need to be protected 
      from overheating fulfill the proposed system characteristics serving as a test system. Adaptive Dynamic 
      Programming (ADP) is used, with an RL technique, for finding the optimal control for a trajectory tracking 
      task. Finally, states restrictions are tackled using Barrier Lyapunov Functions over the optimal control 
      obtained by the ADP. The union of the concepts mentioned above is the main contribution of this work.

    <p>
  The optimal control problem consists of designing the control \(u_{t}^{*}\in \mathbf{U} \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}\), 
  which minimizes a cost functional \(J_{t}\), subjected to the trajectories of a dynamical system 
  \(\dot{x} = \bar{f}(x_{t},u_{t})\), which can be subjected to some physical constraints <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?hl=es&lr=&id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=kirk+optimal+control&ots=xyjIZsc1d1&sig=SbWFKTm6Q3zd4t7ZRNXqf22ApAQ#v=onepage&q=kirk%20optimal%20control&f=false">â€»</a>.
